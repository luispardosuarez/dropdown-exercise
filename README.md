### dropdown-exercise

Exercise to practice the CSS Dropdown feature. The exercise involved creating a dropdown where we could find more information. To gain some practice, I've given the page a bit of structure and applied responsiveness. 

The chosen theme is the discography of one of my favorite bands: Moderat. I used a dropdown so that after reading the album review, you can view its tracklist.

I invite you to turn on your speakers, crank up the volume, and dance to the beat of Moderat! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•ºðŸŽ¶ðŸ”Š
