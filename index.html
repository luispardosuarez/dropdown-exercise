                <h2>MODERAT</h2>
                <p>Moderat is the self-titled first studio album by electronic music project Moderat, the collaborative
                    conjoining of Modeselektor and Apparat.
                    Moderat's self-titled debut makes it sound like these fellas have been working closely together for
                    years -- and the analog production gives these tracks a steady, glowing warmth that pulses and
                    breathes
                    organically.
                    Totally seductive, dark dance tunes that possess an almost tribal disposition for the most intense
                    peak
                    moments. This is a massive debut that unites two of techno's most celebrated acts.
                    It was released on 11 May 2009 on BPitch Control.</p>
