                <h2>MODERAT</h2>
                <p>
                    Moderat is the self-titled first studio album by electronic music project Moderat, the collaborative
                    conjoining of Modeselektor and Apparat.
                    Moderat's self-titled debut makes it sound like these fellas have been working closely together for
                    years -- and the analog production gives these tracks a steady, glowing warmth that pulses and
                    breathes
                    organically.
                    Totally seductive, dark dance tunes that possess an almost tribal disposition for the most intense
                    peak
                    moments. This is a massive debut that unites two of techno's most celebrated acts.
                    Released on 11 May 2009 on BPitch Control.

                <h2>II</h2>
                <p>
                    II is the second studio album by Moderat.
                    Do you like pop music? Are you open to experiencing transcendent moments as part of a huge crowd?
                    Can you admire the songcraft that triggers such communion? These are crucial questions in the case
                    of Moderat's II, an album that maintains an exquisite tension between bruising club music and pure
                    pop, and that is unapologetic in its attempts to deliver big crossover moments.
                    Its potential anthems, hark back to the refined and emotionally fraught pop/soul, while seeking, if
                    only notionally, to take on stadium-conquerors like Coldplay or U2.
                    Released in August 2013.

                <h2>III</h2>
                <p>
                    III is the their studio album. The album absorbs a dark spectrum of
                    postminimal electronic music—the rococo bass and deep contrasts of James Blake, the windy knock and
                    moan of Burial, the sultry lightness of The xx, the granular whir of Four Tet—and reflects it back.
                    It reminds me most of Jamie Woon's underrated Mirrorwriting, from the committed vocal performances
                    down to the new age incense wafting through the spare, softly thundering arrangements. Though it's
                    Moderat's strongest record, III isn't quite all killer. Released on April 1, 2016 and is
                    the third installment to Moderat's album trilogy that includes Moderat and II.

                <h2>MORE D4TA</h2>
                <p>
                    The Moderat trio return from a six-year hiatus with their fourth album, MORE D4TA – and it was worth
                    the wait. Like every Moderat album before it, is a departure and a return; familiar but thrilling in
                    equal measure.
                    Through their ongoing commitment to experimentation and legacy, Moderat have engineered a
                    record which is totally distinct but that also slots neatly into their already enviable back
                    catalogue. MORE D4TA or MODERAT 4 is the sound of a group creatively recharged and at the height of
                    their power. Released on May 13, 2022, it was preceded by the release of the
                    singles "Fast Land", "Easy Prey" and "More Love".
